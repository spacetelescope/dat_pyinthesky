The data can be found at https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/jwst-nirspec/test-data, and detailed and insightful report of the data by G. Giardino, S. Birkmann, P. Ferruit, B. Dorner, B.

    "The CV3 test assessed the stablity of the instrument by introducing a large spatial jitter and drift. This resulted in a significant X,Y movement of the spectra on the 2D detector. While this bulk shift has been removed which aligns the spectra, intra- and inter- pixel sensitivities introduce flux variations which need to be removed. The jitter from the CV3 test was more than 30 mas, which is ~4X larger than the JWST stability requiremnt. Thus, in orbit these detector effects are expected to be significantly smaller, but they will still be present and will need to be modeled and removed from time series observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detector X, Y possitions were measured from cross-correlation and are saved in arrays $shx$ and $shy$. The detetctor shifts have oringinal amplitudes near 0.2 pixels, though the vectors have had inital normalization. For detrending purposes, these arrays should have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.0.\n",

These wavelengths show some increases in time correlated noise ($\\sigma_r$), which has been measured here, and the errors in the plot also show the transit depths with this error included. \n",
